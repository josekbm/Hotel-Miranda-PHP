# Hotel-Miranda-HTML
First project of the Oxygen's training. It is an application developed with HTML, SCSS using the BEM methodology and Vanilla Javascript. The app simulates the web page of a Hotel that will be visible from 320px, and therefore, it will be responsive through a single breakpoint at 1000px.
